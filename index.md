### **Applied Machine Learning Fellow**  
*Los Alamos National Lab, New Mexico*  
**May 2024 – August 2024**
- Worked on the uncertainty quantification of predictions in computer vision models.
- Integrated conformal prediction for bounding boxes in the Masked R-CNN instance segmentation model, achieving a 25% increase in coverage over bootstrapping techniques.
- Achieved desired (1−α)% coverage rate for bounding boxes given a miscoverage value α.

### **Graduate Research Assistant**  
*University of Missouri, Missouri*  
**May 2023 – August 2023**
- Developed a novel spatio-temporal transformer model to detect atmospheric rivers.
- Implemented a temporal dependence structure in a Vision Transformer-based image segmentation model.
- Achieved a state-of-the-art mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) score of 0.68.

### **Decision Sciences Predoc Fellow**  
*Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, India*  
**July 2021 – June 2022**
- Performed comprehensive variable selection in logistic regression using LASSO, Elastic Net, Boruta, VSURF, and other methods.
- Deployed various variable selection methods on a high-dimensional gene-related dataset of over 6000 variables, achieving a 95% reduction in the feature space.
- Implemented parallel computing techniques to accelerate data simulation and fine-tune models.
